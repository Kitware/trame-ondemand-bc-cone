# **MUST** set cluster id here that matches cluster configuration file located
# under /etc/ood/config/clusters.d/*.yml
# @example Use the Owens cluster at Ohio Supercomputer Center
#     cluster: "owens"
# For the docker example at https://github.com/ubccr/hpc-toolset-tutorial,
# we need to use "hpc" for the cluster.
cluster: "hpc"

# Define attribute values that aren't meant to be modified by the user within
# the Dashboard form
attributes:
  # Set the corresponding modules that need to be loaded for Jupyter to run
  #
  # @note It is called within the batch job as `module load <modules>` if
  #   defined
  # @example Do not load any modules
  #     modules: ""
  # @example Using default python module
  #     modules: "python"
  # @example Using specific python module
  #     modules: "python/3.5"
  # @example Using combination of modules
  #     modules: "python/3.5 cuda/8.0.44"
  modules: "python"

  # Any extra command line arguments to feed to the `jupyter notebook ...`
  # command that launches the Jupyter notebook within the batch job
  extra_trame_args: ""

# All of the attributes that make up the Dashboard form (in respective order),
# and made available to the submit configuration file and the template ERB
# files
#
# @note You typically do not need to modify this unless you want to add a new
#   configurable value
# @note If an attribute listed below is hard-coded above in the `attributes`
#   option, then it will not appear in the form page that the user sees in the
#   Dashboard
